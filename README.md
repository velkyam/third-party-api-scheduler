# third-party-api-scheduler
The goal of this project was to develop a day planner site for an emplyee during regular working hours. The application can store user's events in and color coordinates them based on the current time. Present time slot is colored in red, past in gray, and future in green. The planner stores data in local storage, therefore stored events will appear even after closing. Each even has corresponding save button with a checkmark on it.

To test color timing at any specific time, uncomment currentTime varible on line 9 and enter desired time.
